# Apartment-Bill-Calculator-based-on-Consumption

  This Java program calculates the bills for apartments based on their individual electricity consumption. It takes the number of flats and their respective electricity consumption as input and calculates the total bill. Then it calculates the individual bills for each flat based on a formula that considers both the total bill and the individual consumption of each flat. Finally, it prints out the bill for each flat. The program consists of three methods: main(), calculateTheInvoice() and printBills().
